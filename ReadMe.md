A library of animations in Circuit Python

This will hopefully build up to a set of animations of different things that you can use in RBG LED matrices. Each animation will output an 8x8 (this may be adjustable in some) array of (R, G, B) tuples that can be written to your grid.
I hope that there'll be a common interface for each on, but I want to get a few animations up and running first.

Animations
==========

* flame.py -- this is a simple flame effect. It's a long way from perfect, both in look and performance, but it's a start! 
* wine.py -- a simple animation of a wine glass being drunk
* rainbow.py -- attempt at a rainbow (with rain and sun) but this is pretty tricky on an 8x8 grid - it bight be worth adding some sparkle to the rainbow
* rain.py -- a cloud with rain
* lightening.py -- rain but with added pazzaz
* Todo:
 * twinkle
 * PacMan
 * lightenning
